# ImageClassifier

ImageClassifier is a project completed as a part of the Udacity AI Programming with Python course where I developed an classifier using Pytorch that could identify images and classify them into specific categories based off the training data.
Using a dataset of flowers, the classifier was able to consistently have a classification accuracy above 90% on the testing data.
